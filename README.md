# My awesomewm config

For now it's just a modified rc.lua from awesome-copycats + a modified theme.lua from the multicolor theme from that repository

To use these files: 
1. Follow awesome-copycats' install instructions.
2. Clone the repository and symlink or copy the rc.lua file to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome
3. Then symlink/copy theme-personal.lua to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/themes/multicolor

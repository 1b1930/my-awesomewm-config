# My awesomewm config

For now it's just a modified rc.lua from awesome-copycats + a modified theme.lua from the multicolor theme from that repository

To use these files, you need to follow awesome-copycats' install instructions. Then, clone the repository and symlink or copy the rc.lua file to
XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome and copy theme-personal.lua to XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/themes/multicolor
